# Project-Priyansh
Hello everyone, I've successfully written and executed queries for all assigned tasks using few online compilers. The outputs for Academic Management System, Student Databse Management, Event Management System, and OLAP operations are stored as SQL files named Task 1.sql, Task 2.sql, Task 3.sql, and Task 4.sql respectively. I've also included screenshots for each task in files named Task 1 Screenshots.docx, Task 2 Screenshots.docx, Task 3 Screenshots.docx, and Task 4 Screenshots.docx.

Please remember to comment out the CREATE DATABASE line when running the queries for PostgreSQL tasks.

Thank you,
Priyansh Srivastava
